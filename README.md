Simple console window program

Scrapes the unofficial valorant api website to download assets such as sprays and weapon skins

Not sure why anyone would need this tbh but better to have something than nothing.

Script will automatically check if you have already downloaded the files so it won't download again

I gurantee that there will be some bugs here and there

You can also view your deaths on a minimap...

And thats about it!

In total, downloading all assets is around 150MB ish at the time of writing this

I may abandon this or add more features down the line. 
Made this out of boredom and also its cool to see the assets and all of the weapon skins

Inspired by my upcoming feature being added to my app Statics which was to see different weapon skins in app.

Ciao!
