# Valorant Asset Downloader
## Save the executable in a seperate folder as all files will be downloaded to that folder
A nice little console window program!
Scrapes the unofficial valorant api website to download assets such as sprays and weapon skins

Not sure why anyone would need this tbh
But better to have something than nothing.

Script will automatically check if you have already downloaded the files so it won't download again
I gurantee that there will be some bugs here and there

You can also view your deaths on a minimap...

And thats about it!
In total, downloading everything is around 150MB ish

I may abandon this or add more features down the line. 
Made this out of boredom and also its cool to see the assets and all of the weapon skins
Inspired by my upcoming feature being added to my app Statics which was to see weapon skins in app.

Ciao!
